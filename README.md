gameduino
=========

What is it?
-----------

Gameduino is a game adapter for Arduino - or anything else with an SPI interface - built as a single shield that stacks up on top of the Arduino and has plugs for a VGA monitor and stereo speakers.

Legal stuffs
------------

This project was created by James Bowman <jamesb@excamera.com>. I strongly recommand you to visit his website first as it always will contain the more recent and official information about the Gameduino.

Why this repo?
--------------

This github repository is maintained by Manoel Trapier <godzil@godzil.net> for his own project around Gameduino and by the fact there is missing a central repository with all needed file to build/hack your own Gameduino on Internet. James' website will of course store all of thoses files, but they are stored sparses around, and could be difficult to find.


The sound and graphics are definitely old-school, but thanks to the latest FPGA technology, the sprite capabilities are a step above those in machines from the past.

video output is 400x300 pixels in 512 colors
all color processed internally at 15-bit precision
compatible with any standard VGA monitor (800x600 @ 72Hz)
background graphics
512x512 pixel character background
256 characters, each with independent 4 color palette
pixel-smooth X-Y wraparound scroll
foreground graphics
each sprite is 16x16 pixels with per-pixel transparency
each sprite can use 256, 16 or 4 colors
four-way rotate and flip
96 sprites per scan-line, 1536 texels per line
pixel-perfect sprite collision detection
audio output is a stereo 12-bit frequency synthesizer
64 independent voices 10-8000 Hz
per-voice sine wave or white noise
sample playback channel
The adapter is controlled via SPI read/write operations, and looks to the CPU like a 32Kbyte RAM. (Unlike many 8-bit machines, there are no restrictions on when you can access this RAM). There is a handy reference poster showing how the whole system works, and a set of sample programs and library.
